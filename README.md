# 🌤️ Weather Forecast App

A sleek single-screen **Jetpack Compose** weather app that fetches the user's current location using **Google Location Services**, retrieves weather data from the **Open Meteo API**, and displays today's weather along with a 7-day forecast — all while strictly matching a **100% accurate Figma UI design**.

This project applies principles from **Kotlin Unlimited (Season 1 - Section 10)**, using **OOP abstraction**, **MVVM architecture**, **Ktor**, **Koin**, and modern **Android Compose UI** techniques.
